# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A project that employs machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. Utilizing SMOTE oversampling and logistic regression, the model achieves effective fraud detection and visualization."

 Steps & Challenges: 
    Handle Highly Imbalanced Data (Use SMOTE for oversampling). 
    Train Model: Logistic Regression with class_weight='balanced'. 
    Analyze Fraud Patterns: Use t-SNE visualization. 
    Evaluate: ROC-AUC Score, Precision-Recall Curve. 
      Learning Outcome: Fraud detection & dealing with imbalanced datasets.
